# NetLogo Web Image Extension

This extension allows you to directly export image data from NetLogo, as well as to Base64-encode/-decode it.

__Requires NetLogo 5.0.4 or greater.__

## Building

Assuming that the SBT executable is on your path, run `sbt package` to build the `.jar`s.

To build an all-in-one `.jar` (most useful for use in applets), run `sbt assembly` and go dig the resultant `.jar` out of the project's `/target` directory.
